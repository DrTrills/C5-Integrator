C5-Integrator
=============
This project, Concrete5, and Bootstrap are licenseed under MIT. For more info please see http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/

INSTALL:

1. Upload the css file integrator.css to your webserver, then place it in your Concrete5 page header. 

This small css file has overrides for better interaction between the C5 editable regions, as well as the edit bar on top.

2. copy the text from 'Editable-navbar' to your header.php file.  This will push down the default Bootstrap navbar 49px so it is under the C5 Editbar.  This is only for logged in users with admin accounts.  Web viewers won't see the pushed down verison of the navbar.
